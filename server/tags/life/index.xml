      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so much vulnerable men in the world. Men do have feelings. But they deny. Heck, we deny.&#xA;The rise of so much “red pill” podcasts and part-time sex-traffickers, girlfriend beating, chinless men like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Andrew Tate&lt;/a&gt; or proven miscreant turned saviour, Sneako, with a cult following of young vulnerable men is worrisome. Why is this so, you may ask? Well, it’s really hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-bad-representations-exist&#34;&gt;Why bad representations exist.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I genuinely believe the reason for the success of the aforementioned platforms and individuals is because men deep down are looking for a voice, otherwise firm figure to endorse and represent their patriarchal beliefs. It’s a man’s world in most third world countries and Africa, but we can agree that in the Western society today, it’s a “woman’s world” frankly speaking. Which isn’t bad, per say. The problem is, the individuals taking up the baton happen to be shallow-minded and in a way, misrepresent the thoughts and feelings of the majority of men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

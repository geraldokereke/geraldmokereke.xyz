        <p>In many Nigerian households, the role of the <strong>first son</strong> comes with an <em>unspoken weight</em>. It is rarely discussed openly, yet almost every first son knows it. You are groomed to be dependable, to lead quietly, to protect without complaint, and to absorb responsibilities far earlier than you should. For some, this role is guided by love and structure. For others, it is shaped by absence.</p>
<p>My own life shifted when my father <strong>abandoned my siblings and me</strong> when I was barely fourteen. At an age where most boys were figuring out who they were, I was suddenly confronted with what I had to become. My sister battled an illness that affected her brain, my mother was left to carry four children on her shoulders, and I could see clearly that <em>childhood was no longer something I had the luxury to enjoy</em>.</p>

        <p>Nigeria has been stuck in the same cycle for years. We talk about change, promise reform, elect new leaders, yet the country continues to struggle with the same problems: corruption, slow service delivery, poor planning, inconsistent policies, and a political class that often treats public office as a reward rather than a responsibility. At this point, it is clear that politics alone cannot fix Nigeria. What we need is technocracy—not as a replacement for democracy, but as a foundation for serious governance.</p>

        <p>Gerald, why so much hate for Mongo DB? You don&rsquo;t understand <strong>SCALE!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/s3TNdNB/mongodb.png" alt="Mongo DB, A Joke"></p>
<p>Yes, I like boring relational databases. I love SQL, SQLite. Except it&rsquo;s Oracle owned.</p>
<p>Before anything else, once Mongo DB comes up — the first thing that comes to my mind is <em>data integrity</em> as it should be. Mongo DB as we all know is a NoSQL database that has gained popularity over the years. Ah, partly because it’s being used in maybe — <em>every single Node JS beginner tutorial on the internet?</em> Maybe that, or because in standard industries such as banking/finance, education, we tend to lean towards structured data which Mongo DB is a train-wreck for such use cases.</p>

<p>I love Go. For many reasons, at the same time I hate the language. It&rsquo;s the regular toxic love-hate relationship to have for a programming language.
Nothing new. Firstly Go is so much like C. Being a C programmer, it has been an enjoyable experience. The simplicty is fantastic for me.</p>
<p>The only problem with Go is the error handling and, as a matter of fact, the stupid compiler. Though I have some other &ldquo;icks,&rdquo; the aforementioned are the most significant. Anyways, I&rsquo;m not here to rant about Go. Rather, I want to walk you through how I developed a project called &ldquo;Console&rdquo; that you can use to view your system processes, memory, system usage, and system information from a decent GUI.</p>

<p>Boolean Logic is quintessential to the field of computer science and programming
in general. It is an integral component and foundational cornerstone to the way
digital circuits are constructed and data is manipulated.</p>

Boolean Logic and Logic Gates, were among the topics I enjoyed while in high

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I decided to write this essay after the recent rebuttals from the Vanilla
JavaScript community towards Typescript — Typecasting, Typesafety — call it
whatever you wish.</p>
<p>A lot of people who got into programming probably began with dynamic programming
languages — such as Ruby, PHP, Perl, and Python, for example. Hence, being their
&ldquo;first love,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s really hard trying to convince them that those languages may
not be the best choice for large codebases where a lot of collaboration is
needed. Not only that, but runtime errors and clear-in-the-night sky type errors
go unnoticed.</p>

<p>An abacus was one of the earliest computing devices created that was used to
perform the four basic operations in mathematics — addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to be designing a binary abacus from scratch
using C++</p>

<p>This program will be CLI/Terminal based. We would not need any GUI software
necessary to begin. I got interested by stumbling across the video below:</p>

<p>When I started off programming I really had a very wrong perception of a
&ldquo;development environment&rdquo; or &ldquo;development setup.&rdquo; This led to me, eventually
wanting to do the most. Effectively creating an amazing workflow to most people
with very much reduced productivity. Now, I&rsquo;ve come to realise that a
development setup isn&rsquo;t necessarily spawning an ultra wide $5,000 monitor. But
creating a very productive environment that maximises your experience and gets
the best out of your abilities.</p>

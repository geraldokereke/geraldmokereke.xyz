        <p>The performance of mobile applications is extremely important. Users want a seamless experience with almost no bugs or glitches — to save yourself the violent reviews your mobile app would get on the app stores. Or preferably reduce? Because haters will hate.</p>
<p>JavaScript is arguably a performant language naturally. It&rsquo;s the pinnacle of all web applications that run on the client. A modern day functioning app cannot exist without shipping JavaScript modules to the client. There are several <a href="https://webtips.dev/webtips/javascript/benchmark-javascript" target="_blank">benchmarking tools to illustrate this</a>.</p>

        <p>The &ldquo;<a href="https://nicfost.gov.ng/" target="_blank">Nigerian Council of Food Science and Technology</a> is a professional body in Nigeria that is focused advancing the field of food science and technology in the country. It serves as an organization for professionals, researchers, educators, and practitioners who are involved in various aspects of food science and technology.</p>
<p>They have a portal that is used by the adminstrative team at Nicfost. The client side is written entirely in JavaScript. I didn&rsquo;t build the client, it was written by someone else. After all, I have expressed my distate severall on this blog for JavaScript as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4113458" target="_blank">a bad dynamic programming language for robust projects</a>. I use Typescript instead. The backend is also written in Java, I didn&rsquo;t write the initial Java backend though - which I wish I did. The refactoring and process wasn&rsquo;t funny.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s solve the shortest path problem</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to be solving the shortest path problem by implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm</a> with some Python. So get a cup of coffee and a neovim buffer opened, it&rsquo;s going to be a ride.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-shortest-path-problem">What is the shortest path problem?</h2>
<p>Before we begin, we must first understand what is the shortest path problem. The shortest path problem is a fundamental optimization problem in computer science, speficifically graph theory under discrete mathematics or data structures and algorithms. It involves finding the shortest path or the minimum distance between two nodes (vertices) in a weighted graph. The &ldquo;shortest path&rdquo; is defined as the path with the smallest total sum of edge weights or distances. From this, we can tell that we would be working with a non-linear data structure throughout this article, The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplilearn.com%2Ftutorials%2Fdata-structure-tutorial%2Fgraphs-in-data-structure&amp;psig=AOvVaw1b4ReK_eZpIpF0QyT36lVf&amp;ust=1694343143651000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2sPSarp2BAxXDpycCHfeZAt4Qr4kDegQIARBx" target="_blank">&ldquo;graph.&rdquo;</a></p>

        <p><em>Officially a failed state, what next?</em></p>
<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s situation is a laughable one. Imagine being led by a president who has quite a <a href="https://gazettengr.com/u-s-court-releases-certified-true-copies-of-bola-tinubus-drug-dealing-money-laundering-case-in-chicago/" target="_blank">disturbing criminal record history</a>.</p>
<p>Then, a <a href="https://saharareporters.com/2022/07/11/flashback-how-tinubu%E2%80%99s-running-mate-shettima%E2%80%99s-government-borno-contributed-abduction" target="_blank">vice president who allegedly has had dealings with Boko Haram</a>.</p>
<p>Or the current Chief of Staff to the president select, a former head of the House of Representatives who was a <a href="https://saharareporters.com/2019/06/05/exclusive-gbajabiamila-was-found-guilty-supreme-court-georgia-us" target="_blank">convicted criminal in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Then, much recently, they appointed a criminal who <a href="https://gazettengr.com/wike-should-be-jailed-for-oil-bunkering-mindless-looting-of-rivers-treasury-ned-nwoko/" target="_blank">looted Rivers&rsquo; state wealth and participated in the rigging of the elections</a> on the President Select&rsquo;s request, Nyesom Wike, as the Minister of Abuja.</p>

<p>Infuriating to say, &ldquo;Tech Bro&rdquo; is not something I&rsquo;d like to be called or I&rsquo;d like to address someone as.

        <p>Neovim is actually overrated. I don&rsquo;t really understand the buzz with some lua scripted, terminal based editor, which is a Vim rip-off. Which same human being hits &ldquo;gg&rdquo; to go to the top of a line, and &ldquo;ggVG&rdquo; with case sensitivity in mind to select all content?</p>
<p>Hold up. I got you in the first paragraph, didn&rsquo;t I? Neovim is a pretty cool Vim based editor that I still can not understand why people may hate on or have misgivings about it.</p>

        <p>There are so much vulnerable men in the world. Men do have feelings. But they deny. Heck, we deny.
The rise of so much “red pill” podcasts and part-time sex-traffickers, girlfriend beating, chinless men like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate" target="_blank">Andrew Tate</a> or proven miscreant turned saviour, Sneako, with a cult following of young vulnerable men is worrisome. Why is this so, you may ask? Well, it’s really hard to say.</p>
<h2 id="why-bad-representations-exist">Why bad representations exist.</h2>
<p>I genuinely believe the reason for the success of the aforementioned platforms and individuals is because men deep down are looking for a voice, otherwise firm figure to endorse and represent their patriarchal beliefs. It’s a man’s world in most third world countries and Africa, but we can agree that in the Western society today, it’s a “woman’s world” frankly speaking. Which isn’t bad, per say. The problem is, the individuals taking up the baton happen to be shallow-minded and in a way, misrepresent the thoughts and feelings of the majority of men.</p>

        <p>Johan Cruyff is regarded as one of the greatest players and coaches of all time. He is remembered for the very attractive, unique technical approach to football he employed at Barcelona, which he inherited from Rinus Michels&rsquo; ideology at Ajax.</p>
<p>This is why Ajax, historically, would forever be an essential piece to modern-day football.</p>
<p>Cruyff took the idea to Barcelona where he developed it. By carrying the Dutch philosophy or Ajax system to Barcelona, he also inspired other coaches at that time in Spain to adopt the philosophy. That is why, to date, it appears as if every LaLiga team adopted some variation of positional play, which casuals would be known to refer to as &ldquo;Tiki Taka.&rdquo;</p>

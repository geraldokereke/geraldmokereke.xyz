      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article you would learn how to properly structure and craft decent, intuitive and readable commit messages that summarise the context of the code you published to either a remote or local branch of a repository. This would be helpful if you work on collaborative projects, and would also save you the mental stress of trying to figure out a commit. I was once guilty of creating incredibly confusing and inappropriate commit messages, that did not capture the context of my code. I totally underestimated the concept of good commit messages, feeling &amp;ldquo;code readablity&amp;rdquo; was far more important to understand. That the code itself should tell, and not the messages. I was wrong, and I do not want you to be caught up in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

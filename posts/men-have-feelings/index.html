            <p>There are so much vulnerable men in the world. Men do have feelings. But they deny. Heck, we deny.
The rise of so much “red pill” podcasts and part-time sex-traffickers, girlfriend beating, chinless men like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate" target="_blank">Andrew Tate</a> or proven miscreant turned saviour, Sneako, with a cult following of young vulnerable men is worrisome. Why is this so, you may ask? Well, it’s really hard to say.</p>
<h2 id="why-bad-representations-exist">Why bad representations exist.</h2>
<p>I genuinely believe the reason for the success of the aforementioned platforms and individuals is because men deep down are looking for a voice, otherwise firm figure to endorse and represent their patriarchal beliefs. It’s a man’s world in most third world countries and Africa, but we can agree that in the Western society today, it’s a “woman’s world” frankly speaking. Which isn’t bad, per say. The problem is, the individuals taking up the baton happen to be shallow-minded and in a way, misrepresent the thoughts and feelings of the majority of men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up b***h”
~ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDJmqJSG3XE" target="_blank">Andrew Tate, in a Youtube video</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the above quote there speaks volumes. This is not Tate centric, but you can imagine how a man like this who claims to be a voice of young men boasts about assaulting a lady. Utterly disgusting. Perhaps all she did was ask him where his chin was. Men who say things like these, ooze “insecurity.” Coupled with the fact that he is always, literally exalting himself up to the high heavens with his words constantly that is not equivalent to his physical or mental abilities, is amusing.</p>
<p>The goal of Tate and other red pill platforms, for example; “The fresh and fit” podcast is to teach men how to become an “Alpha Male.” A societal wolverine and the embodiment of sheer masculinity. This they tell them is by achieving a physical build. According to them you’ve got to be “ripped to the core.” Eat a lot of meat and proteins to send those testosterone levels soaring out the window. You have to embrace traditional patriarchy. Your wife is your property. At the basic level, they indulge men to embrace misogynistic views of women in general. Then lastly, they tell you to work hard and get some money. Why? So you can supposedly pick your ex’s best friend in a Mercedes to get back at her.</p>
<h2 id="the-alpha-male-misrepresentation">The alpha male misrepresentation.</h2>
<p>Something I find really interesting is the misinterpretation of “alpha male.” A man who is generally successful and influential in his own way or field of expertise is an alpha male. Being in the top 10% of the wealthiest elite makes you an alpha. What the red pill ambassadors are selling you is a “healthy lifestyle” which is extremely important and becoming a jock. Men need better role models in the world, and they are. Not how you can actually climb up the societal ladder to make your life worth living without going the criminal route.</p>
<p>Even if you are a great athlete in sports, it is certainly something to be proud of and you don’t want to be caught on camera or a recording assaulting your girlfriend or the mother of your children over frivolous or petty reasons. At the end, men need to acknowledge the fact that “girls, will be girls.” It’s human nature. You cannot expect them to exude a level of competency or ability in every single thing you expect them to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But, What a man can do, a woman can do that better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They motivated our women with fallacy and the red pill-ers, went ahead to embrace the ideology. So you can do it better, eh? Alright. “Let’s take turns to change the light bulbs and wash the car.” Disturbing. I see ideologies like these tossed around my timeline occasionally. In as much as we men have feelings and need someone to relate to, or draw inspiration from - we need to be weary of how quick we jump onto their hype train. A man who hits his wife except in self defence, is a weak man. A man who abandons his children is an infidel. A man who is promiscuous is digging his grave. A man who is clean, respectful and learned is an amazing person. A man who takes care of his family, fulfills his responsibilities and strives to give his children a better man is a great man.</p>
<p>You’re not a simp. You’re not brainwashed or owned by a system, you are just being a normal human being with a 0.05% tendency of getting in the law books for crime. You are only a weak man too when you overdo the sharing of your emotions. Understand that. Men cry. You should cry. Or else, God would have altered the eyes of male children from birth. It&rsquo;s part of human life. But on a podcast, because you can&rsquo;t control your home? Or use that as a motivation to mislead men on Twitter and other forums to playdown your hurt? No way, brother.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves sympathy. But do not be hungry for it. Do not destroy the lives of other men with terrible advice. Fix yourself up brother. That&rsquo;s all you need. Block out the influencers, the red-pillers. Just be yourself. You may be unlucky, taken for granted. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should drop your guards down. Just go out there and win, boy.</p>

            <p><em>Officially a failed state, what next?</em></p>
<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s situation is a laughable one. Imagine being led by a president who has quite a <a href="https://gazettengr.com/u-s-court-releases-certified-true-copies-of-bola-tinubus-drug-dealing-money-laundering-case-in-chicago/" target="_blank">disturbing criminal record history</a>.</p>
<p>Then, a <a href="https://saharareporters.com/2022/07/11/flashback-how-tinubu%E2%80%99s-running-mate-shettima%E2%80%99s-government-borno-contributed-abduction" target="_blank">vice president who allegedly has had dealings with Boko Haram</a>.</p>
<p>Or the current Chief of Staff to the president select, a former head of the House of Representatives who was a <a href="https://saharareporters.com/2019/06/05/exclusive-gbajabiamila-was-found-guilty-supreme-court-georgia-us" target="_blank">convicted criminal in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Then, much recently, they appointed a criminal who <a href="https://gazettengr.com/wike-should-be-jailed-for-oil-bunkering-mindless-looting-of-rivers-treasury-ned-nwoko/" target="_blank">looted Rivers&rsquo; state wealth and participated in the rigging of the elections</a> on the President Select&rsquo;s request, Nyesom Wike, as the Minister of Abuja.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose it, boys.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear that freedom is different from liberty. In some way, there is an external influence or hand in our country&rsquo;s politics and affairs that the ignorant Nigerian cannot perceive.</p>
<p>Our leaders are puppets, in the hands of foreigners. I think this became obvious when the U.S. used Tinubu to start tension between Nigeria, ECOWAS, and Niger under the guise of &ldquo;restoring democracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh no, those are your colonial masters getting mad that your neighboring African countries are waking up and refusing to be ruled by foreign puppets.</p>
<p>That makes daddy Macron angry. I mean, do you know just how much worth of resources the French government extorts from Niger and other African countries they have a stronghold on?</p>
<p>Never mind that. Let&rsquo;s talk about our mess. Why on earth would a country have even a minority in a population of people who think this current corrupt government will work for us?</p>
<p>I thought the lunacy in this country stopped on the roads, the streets of Lagos, and the market squares of Benin. Hell no. Nigeria is a failed state.</p>
<p>What is a failed state? &ldquo;A failed state is a nation that has lost its ability to govern the populace.&rdquo; ~ Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say, theoretically speaking, if we are to define a failed state - Nigeria remains a prominent example. Nothing is working. Our educational system is a disgrace. Our students are being taught dinosaur-age quality curricula. Our professors are underpaid, and our schools lack third-world facilities. It&rsquo;s that bad. Is there a fourth world? Because I&rsquo;m being generous. We&rsquo;re losing our intellectuals to other serious nations.</p>
<p>Our healthcare facilities? Don&rsquo;t let me get started. Our public hospitals have nurses who do not know what Bacterial Meningitis is and what to administer, and our surgeons are part-time meat sellers who may misplace a tool in your stomach. The toilets?</p>
<p>Yikes. Better being burnt to ashes for a rebuild than sanitized ever.</p>
<p>Employment? Jokes on you, too. Our minimum wage is what our politicians spend on filling up their car tanks. An out-of-school first-class college graduate in engineering, medicine, or a solid discipline is expected to earn about N50,000 - N100,000 if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Hmmm. It&rsquo;s a no-braine our boys have to indulge in betting to feed. Get a car to run an Uber, get into cutting hair, doing odd jobs, or even become a personal assistant for their fellow age mates who are sons of politicians. These same guys cannot present a high school diploma in many cases.</p>
<p>The motivated ones are looking for master&rsquo;s scholarships as a guise to immigrate for a better life. Oh, and our girls - they&rsquo;re stuck at home, on their phones, and maybe getting coaxed into the idea of doing hookups for that shiny Apple iPhone.</p>
<p>When a country&rsquo;s education is fourth world standard, the healthcare facilities are to be avoided because it may just be the doctor killing you and not the illness, and even the most competent graduates can&rsquo;t get jobs.</p>
<p>Yeah, your nation is a failed state.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the way forward? Everyone asks.
I&rsquo;m usually optimistic, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t see any light at the end of the tunnel. It&rsquo;s absolute darkness at the start and the end.</p>
<p>Every single section, unit, and arm of the government has been bought over by Ahmed Tinubu. You just witnessed yesterday how they struck out every single suit against the APC even though it had a lot of merit to it.</p>
<p>Shettima&rsquo;s smile in court while being read out his double nomination tells you all you need to know.</p>
<p>We are finished. We are going down hard. Those embassies better start locking up quickly, boys. Because they&rsquo;re about to have a scary influx. At this point, allowing flexible immigration from Nigeria to your nation is like allowing a swarm of ants into that honey jar. Lots of them are going to die in that honey trying to taste it by accident.</p>
<p>Also clocked a dollar to naira is now N900 (Naira)</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Why is this even a currency?
Anyways, for once — switch off that Sports channel, Big Brother Naija (a disgusting show anyways and distraction), and just reflect on the nation&rsquo;s situation and how you could somehow manage to survive.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t care about politics or the situation are possibly too rich off Nigeria to bother or are benefiting. But you, the common man? Understand your priorities, my friend.</p>
<p>The supreme court, is the last bus stop, &ldquo;legally.&rdquo; Hehe. Disclaimer, I said &ldquo;legally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I started off programming I really had a very wrong perception of a
&ldquo;development environment&rdquo; or &ldquo;development setup.&rdquo; This led to me, eventually
wanting to do the most. Effectively creating an amazing workflow to most people
with very much reduced productivity. Now, I&rsquo;ve come to realise that a
development setup isn&rsquo;t necessarily spawning an ultra wide $5,000 monitor. But
creating a very productive environment that maximises your experience and gets
the best out of your abilities.</p>
<h2 id="starting-hard-with-vim">Starting hard with Vim</h2>
<p>If I can remember correctly - my first experience with Vim - was being petrified
about getting stuck in an unusual terminal environment that I could not exit
easily. I tried everything. To even powering off my computer in fear of what I
had done. I attempted again, consulted Google. Nothing. Quit the terminal. I was
the <a href="https://i.redd.it/5yz0nnw08qm61.jpg" target="_blank">living meme on the Vim subreddit</a> at
that point.</p>

<p>Reflecting on that and where I am today really makes me laugh. It was truly a
fun ride. That was early in the 2009s and 2010s. There was no &ldquo;cool&rdquo;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" target="_blank">LSPs (Language Server Protocol)</a>
to do some autocomplete, there was no treesitter or any of the available cool integrations
today.</p>
<p>The advantages of Vim which I realised on the early onset were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extremely light and portable</strong>: Vim was well suited to computers running on
low memory or CPU. This was what made it perfect for me. At that time, I was
running netbeans on my system and it was causing a major lag.</li>
<li><strong>Felt like a game</strong>: Being a kid, I really enjoyed the odd keybindings it
took to execute certain commands on my Vim. It gave me this game feeling and I
absolutely enjoyed it.</li>
<li><strong>The hollywood hacker persona</strong>: Anytime my relatives came around for
Christmas, Easter or any holidays - I would bam! Inside vim, inside a pile of
long ass bash commands and disorganised C code to run a simple CLI calculator.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping strangers off</strong>: Anyone who got into Vim on my computer then was
basically confused. So this in a way was pretty helpful in keeping strangers
off.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems I faced as of then were related to poor autocomplete, no cool
features and GUI like <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">codeblocks</a> and
<a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/" target="_blank">netbeans</a> gave me later on in my development
life. Hence, I eventually dropped Vim, landed upon Windows. The transition was
quite difficult. I struggled earlier on with the command prompt in Windows
because bash just seemed so much better.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>I was basically a C programmer. I spent most of my time writing CLI
applications. From calculators, to minimalistic games. That was all I could
basically do. Till I came across JavaScript - which then changed my scope
in 2016. JavaScript was bubbling and I had hopped on the hype train. I learnt
JSON, JavaScript Syntax, Node JS and began to build browser based web pages at
that time. My first site was a single HTML page with a JavaScript implementation
popping my name up from nowhere which was pretty cool. Most tutorials I began to
follow all used a similar IDE. This was
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, and eventually I picked it
up to be in sync with the tutorials I watched.</p>
<p>Boy. I loved it. I could install so many cool extensions that I wasn&rsquo;t privy to
on my Vim. It seemed like my development was getting better. I enjoyed the
syntax highlighting, integrated terminal - the search feature. It was crazy.
Fast forward, I got so sucked up into the GUI crew that I began to handle by Git
workflow via a GUI. My first Github account came out the following year or two
years with the username <a href="https://github.com/mgeraldoj" target="_blank">Mgeraldoj</a> which
unfortunately, I pretty much lost access to.</p>
<p>I was a VScode ambassador at that point, cycling through crazy themes,
extensions and essentially making my RAM and CPU regret being in my hands -
which I didn&rsquo;t realise anyways. One day, I stumbled across a
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-best-of-both-worlds-visual-studio-code-vim-f8e343eb070f" target="_blank">post that talked
about the Vim Plugin in VScode</a>.
I was instantly hooked. I tried it out. I won&rsquo;t lie, i was embarrassingly rusty.
I eventually started using it then dropped it again, to lay back on VSCode&rsquo;s own
keybindings.</p>
<p>What changed it?</p>
<h2 id="vim-again">Vim again</h2>
<p>I had a whole lot of channels I watched on YouTube then to keep me
motivated. I used these channels as <em>background noise</em>. One of my favourite
channels as of the time was the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive" target="_blank">George Hotz Archive</a> that would
eventually hook me on Vim, again.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYxwe-bYkrU?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz" target="_blank">George Hotz</a> is a cool systems level
programmer I followed for many reasons. I mean, it seemed like he loved C and
the only thing with me that didn&rsquo;t sync with him, was his avid use of Python.</p>
<p>I was blown away - he was extremely fast. I am trying to mimmick his movements
and I&rsquo;m nothing close to him. He&rsquo;s in a terminal window, practically schooling
me on what it means to be productive. Questions were plopping into my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>How on earth, is he moving that fast?</li>
<li>How does he jump between several terminal windows? What terminal does he use?
Which tabs? But he&rsquo;s on a single tab.</li>
<li>How does his Vim look like this? A little bit of syntax highlighting?</li>
<li>HOW CAN I BE LIKE THIS?</li>
</ul>
<p>I began to hunt very diligently for ideas to get a similar workflow. I copied
his Vim dotfiles, I essentially wrote some vimscript, set up keybindings. I was
still kind of abysmal. How was he jumping that fast between windows, I still
didn&rsquo;t know. My goodness, I wanted to just relapse on Visual Studio Code again,
but his workflow was so enticing to implement. I am running through articles on
Hackernews, Reddit before eventually stumbling across an editor that would
change my life and workflow. Neovim.</p>
<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>
<p>The articles, screenshots and forums I came across were buzzing about Neovim.
Infact - I succumbed quickly to the peer pressure. My first experience with
Neovim was trying to get the executable, like a <code>neovim.exe</code> installed on my
Windows machine? Hey. Laugh all you want, sucker. It proved otherwise. Something
beautiful I appreciated about the Neovim community was how much exposure I got
to CLI based tooling, and even WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux). Sooner or
later, I had told my best friend - I was moving off the Windows train.</p>
<p>Attempting to relive the past moments. In less than a year, I had ported fully
to Ubuntu, a
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">debian distribution of Linux</a>. I did not
regret. I truly recommend except you&rsquo;re someone who is heavily invested on the
<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp" target="_blank">C# and .NET stack</a>,
<a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwi4zPSniLyBAxUMx-0KHaoSCA8YABARGgJkZw&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw06-oBhC6ARIsAGuzdw3NJVuBHK57kgmLNRnSBDDRKCpy1OInak3WsRCRSb5Wd9UIFYKLO0MaAgZ5EALw_wcB&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESa-D2XMkE3sPtkgeZd3TvUlsHOeIb59zsZgXVkoWmhu29fPPkVnzqxXjqqpLinNpb2hx-trZEffAEnppAxvTNAZw416vsQsmA7moHV6shxYKrrB0ptGHrLC3rZl1uxRjEdBKzj8U0zSTK_lz_&amp;sig=AOD64_2Z6W0n9uLf1C9GyWtZu_BpVUuBcA&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD9-yniLyBAxUViVwKHd81CP0Q0Qx6BAgKEAE" target="_blank">Windows Server</a>
and Microsoft platform? You should definitely port to Linux. I promise you, that
you would enjoy it and become really productive. You escape the .exe and MSI
installers for packages and that disgusting font called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/ftmehh/why_does_the_consolas_font_look_weird_on_vs_code/" target="_blank">Consolas</a>
or
<a href="https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?t=38214" target="_blank">&ldquo;Segoe EWWW I&rdquo; (Segoe UI)</a>.</p>
<p>In general, Neovim was amazing. It was basically an improved version or
distribution of Vim, packed with a lot of features. This time, you would write
your configurations in a programming language called <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a>
which is a really easy to understand and intuitive language. Guess what this
meant? Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more Vimscript (<code>.Vimrc</code>) again for configurations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What did this mean? The advent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" target="_blank">Language Server Protocols</a>
providing <em>intellisense</em> to a language such as autocomplete, suggestions and
snippets. Speeding up my productivity. Not to mention, other features of an IDE,
like a status bar, a file explorer called a <strong>NerdTree</strong> - the formatters, the
debuggers, the syntax highlighting thanks to <strong>treesitter</strong> and oh baby, we were
ready to do madness with all of these.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was like Ben 10 discovering something greater than the
<a href="https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Ultimatrix_%28Original%29" target="_blank">ultimatrix</a>. Neovim, was
the next big thing. The community too was fantastic.</p>
<h2 id="losing-my-configurations">Losing my configurations</h2>
<p>My basic Neovim setup was absolutely not minimalistic. It was bloated. A cool
background colour which would fry my eyes today and some other configurations.
At the basic level this was the most important components of my configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The status-line. I needed to see the name of my file, the branch I was on. The
LSP that was active. How many lines and columns I was on, and so on.</li>
<li>Telescope. I wanted to search through my files easily, without the <code>grep</code>.</li>
<li>The Nerdtree, because nobody is writing code without a file explorer or way to
navigate.</li>
<li>Treesitter.</li>
<li>Git integrations.</li>
<li>Glyphs which looked pretty cool when I used and installed a nerdfont.</li>
<li>An integrated terminal, which I would end up not using that much after
figuring out why
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ey78p3/vimmers_with_heavy_configs_every_thought_about/" target="_blank">Hotz was so productive</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those were the basic building blocks of my neovim configurations. The rest, were
well - excess. But nevermind - how about you check out my configurations?</p>
<h2 id="tldr-my-development-environment">tl:dr; My Development environment</h2>
<p>tl:dr?</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s my setup exactly? You&rsquo;d be surprised to find out how extremely
minimalistic it is, compared to the bloatware I had before. I&rsquo;ll start off with
the editors I use at the basic level. I starred them below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neovim. *</li>
<li>Intelli J IDEA *</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code *</li>
<li>Tmux a multiplexer. Lets me use one tab, create multiple windows.</li>
<li>Starship.rs</li>
<li>Zsh</li>
<li>Fish Shell</li>
<li>Alacritty terminal</li>
<li>Wezterm terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>I use Neovim for basically everything. You&rsquo;d find me on Intelli J when on Java
based projects for example with
<a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a> or on Scala based
projects. This is because I genuinely believe the experience of Intelli J for
Java, Scala and Kotlin projects is absolutely unbeatable. Would still use vim
for editing. I also use Visual Studio Code as well for remote server, and very
occasionally. I am also fond of this recent IDE called <a href="https://zed.dev/" target="_blank">Zed</a>
due to their early support for Elixir.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-neovim">Setting up Neovim</h3>
<p>My neovim is quite minimalistic as possible, to start with to maximise my
productivity and efficiency. In order to get the best out of my neovim with
liberty to still make certain edits to my experience, I use a Neovim
distribution popularly known as <a href="https://nvchad.com/docs/features" target="_blank">Nvchad</a>. Now
there are several distributions, where you can choose from such as
<a href="https://astronvim.com/" target="_blank">Astrovim</a> and <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/" target="_blank">Lunarvim</a>,
but I find Nvchad better, and I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. You can set up Nvchad by
<a href="https://nvchad.com/docs/features" target="_blank">visiting their documentation</a>. Maybe you&rsquo;d be
&ldquo;chad&rdquo; enough.</p>
<p>Like I said my configuration is minimalistic and the only thing that changes is
my theme. I use the <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox" target="_blank">Grubvox</a> theme.
Possibly because it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes, for me.</p>

plugins for Tmux that I would use. As you can see, I do not really use so much

<p><a href="https://starship.rs" target="_blank">Starship is a customisable prompt for any shell</a> I just
use this, because it&rsquo;s a pretty good prompt. You can install this via

It&rsquo;s actually written in rust. Need I say, you&rsquo;d be quite concerned as we go
along how many rust tooling I use in my workflow despite not being an avid Rust
programmer myself. This is my starship configuration below in TOML, incase you
want to use it:</p>

pretty fast, and I do not code outside Alacritty except it&rsquo;s

the performance. You can visit

<p>This is my <code>Yaml</code>, which I used to configure my use. I borrowed the

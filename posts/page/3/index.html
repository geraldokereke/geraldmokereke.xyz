        <p>Johan Cruyff is regarded as one of the greatest players and coaches of all time. He is remembered for the very attractive, unique technical approach to football he employed at Barcelona, which he inherited from Rinus Michels&rsquo; ideology at Ajax.</p>
<p>This is why Ajax, historically, would forever be an essential piece to modern-day football.</p>
<p>Cruyff took the idea to Barcelona where he developed it. By carrying the Dutch philosophy or Ajax system to Barcelona, he also inspired other coaches at that time in Spain to adopt the philosophy. That is why, to date, it appears as if every LaLiga team adopted some variation of positional play, which casuals would be known to refer to as &ldquo;Tiki Taka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this article, I will walk you through the entire process of dockerizing a Spring Boot application, and connecting it to a PostgreSQL database which would be spun up in a seperate container. I assume you have a little knowledge of <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a>. I initially planned to do a Docker tutorial. I think at the time of writing this&ndash;I have a draft on medium about it. Expect an article soon based on Docker.</p>

<p>Matplotlib is a library used to create visualisations of data in the Python programming language. With matplotlib, you can create two-dimensional graphs using Python Scripts. It’s pretty cool and I will be showing you how you could use it for your subsequent projects, research and schoolwork alongside the Jupyter Notebook tool.</p>
<h3 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks.</h3>
<p>A Jupyter Notebook is a locally hosted web application used for machine learning and data science tasks, which involves writing models, documenting models and visualising their implementation with tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn (an alternative). It is relatively easy to set up and configure. You can easily install it by using the pip package manager, or <a href="https://anaconda.org" target="_blank">Anaconda</a></p>

<p>In this article you would learn how to properly structure and craft decent, intuitive and readable commit messages that summarise the context of the code you published to either a remote or local branch of a repository. This would be helpful if you work on collaborative projects, and would also save you the mental stress of trying to figure out a commit. I was once guilty of creating incredibly confusing and inappropriate commit messages, that did not capture the context of my code. I totally underestimated the concept of good commit messages, feeling &ldquo;code readablity&rdquo; was far more important to understand. That the code itself should tell, and not the messages. I was wrong, and I do not want you to be caught up in a similar situation.</p>

<p>This article will cover the topic of application programming interfaces, which is an essential unit that makes up the microservice architecture.</p>
<h3 id="the-microservice-architecture">The Microservice Architecture.</h3>
<p>The micro service architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is broken into several units, communicating effectively with each other over a network protocol. In contrast to <a href="https://g.co/kgs/apoGDN" target="_blank">monolith applications</a>, which contains the entire logic, client side and server side units in one package that is deployed on a server. On the other hand, the Microservice architecture has its units loosely coupled together, and in most cases distributed across multiple system servers. This is why in many cases, the micro service architecture is referred to as a type of <a href="https://g.co/kgs/WHxZ7E" target="_blank"><em>distributed system</em></a>.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn how to install storybook and configure it with tailwindcss, in a Next JS project. I have used these tools to build several side projects of mine and even professional projects.
I hope you find it interesting.</p>
<h3 id="why-tailwind-and-storybook">Why Tailwind and Storybook?</h3>
<p>It boils down to your preference. Storybook is a pretty nice tool that could be used alongside several CSS in options. From utility first frameworks such as tailwindcss, to Chakra UI, CSS in JS (Styled Components) or plain styling in CSS.</p>

<p>There is an awful lot that goes into writing good code that abides by proper Object-Oriented Programming principles. In this tutorial I will basically cover the importance and significance of writing quality code (though I feel that quality code is subjective) thereby avoding &ldquo;Oops in Oop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note: &ldquo;Oops&rdquo; is basically an exclamation made after a significant mistake or accident rather.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction.</h3>
<p>Just like I was roaming Stackoverflow, you’ve probably been wondering how to set up React JS with the Laravel framework. React is arguably one of the most powerful libraries for building user-interfaces. Yes, it’s a library, not really a framework. It forms the view component of web applications. Laravel on the other hand, is a powerful open-source PHP framework used for building small to robust web applications. It implements the model-view-controller (MVC) software architecture. Both tools, seem to go pretty well with certain tools, without having to stress at all.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Johan Cruyff is regarded as one of the greatest players and coaches of all time. He is remembered for the very attractive, unique technical approach to football he employed at Barcelona, which he inherited from Rinus Michels&amp;rsquo; ideology at Ajax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why Ajax, historically, would forever be an essential piece to modern-day football.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cruyff took the idea to Barcelona where he developed it. By carrying the Dutch philosophy or Ajax system to Barcelona, he also inspired other coaches at that time in Spain to adopt the philosophy. That is why, to date, it appears as if every LaLiga team adopted some variation of positional play, which casuals would be known to refer to as &amp;ldquo;Tiki Taka.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
